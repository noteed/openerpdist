{"name":"openerpdist","tagline":"Build the OpenERP framework and addons as nice tarballs","body":"# openerpdist - Packaging and distributing OpenERP\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` builds the OpenERP framework and addons as nice tarballs, ready\r\nto be uploaded to pypi with minimal changes from upstream sources.\r\n\r\nThis project is unsupported by OpenERP s.a.\r\n\r\nPlease note that even if `openerpdist` itself uses a 3-clause BSD license, the\r\nresulting packages remain under the AGPL license.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` builds packages ready to be consumed by the Python\r\ninfrastructure. In particular, it uses the regular `setup.py` files (using\r\n`setuptools`), and the resulting tarballs are installable using e.g. `pip`.\r\n\r\nOne possible usage is to generate the desired packages and make them available\r\nthrough a web server with an HTML listing (e.g. Nginx with `autoindex on`).\r\nPackages can then be installed for instance in a new virtual env:\r\n\r\n    > virtualenv2 oe-env\r\n    > oe-env/bin/pip install openerp-sale \\\r\n        --no-index \\\r\n        --find-links http://localhost/tarballs\r\n        \r\nor alternatively you can edit [`$HOME/.pip/pip.conf`](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/configuration.html#configuration) file and append:\r\n\r\n    [global]\r\n    find-links =\r\n        http://localhost/tarballs\r\n\r\nand then just use:\r\n\r\n    > virtualenv2 oe-env\r\n    > oe-env/bin/pip install openerp-sale\r\n\r\nPackage dependencies are extracted from the `__openerp__.py` descriptor files\r\nand listed in the generated `setup.py` files. This means that installing, say,\r\n`openerp-sale` will install all its dependencies, including `openerp-core` (the\r\npackage for the server/framework).\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nThe development version can be installed by cloning the Git repository and using cabal:\r\n\r\n    > git clone git://github.com/noteed/openerpdist.git\r\n    > cd openerpdist && cabal install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` is simple to use, either within the server source directory, or\r\nwithin a specific addons, or from a directory containing multiple addons.\r\n\r\nThe command\r\n\r\n    > openerpdist patch\r\n\r\nwhen run inside a serve source tree, will replace the existing `setup.py` and\r\n`MANIFEST.in` files; for addons it will generate a `setup.py` file. Note that\r\nit will first check with `bzr diff` if the directory (assumed to be a `.bzr`\r\nrepository) is clean.\r\n\r\nOnce done, you can simply execute\r\n\r\n    > openerpdist sdist\r\n\r\nto generate some nice tarballs inside the newly created `dist` directories.\r\n\r\n## Other dependencies\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` lists the correct dependencies in the `setup.py` file. This is\r\nenough for Python dependencies. But in addition, some of those dependencies,\r\nand thus indirectly the packaged OpenERP libraries, need libraries and\r\nprograms to be installed with your operating system facilities.\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 those additional dependencies are:\r\n\r\n(The list is incomplete for now.)\r\n\r\n- libjpeg-dev\r\n- zlib1g-dev\r\n\r\nlibjpeg-dev and zlib1g-dev are for JPEG and ZIP support in Pillow (`openerpdist`\r\nsets Pillow instead of PIL).\r\n\r\n## Limitations / TODO\r\n\r\n- Assume the directories where `openerpdist` is run are `bzr` repositories.\r\n- Does not generate a README file from the `__openerp__.py` descriptor.\r\n- The version used for each package is hard-coded to 7.0.1.\r\n- The listed dependencies for `openerp-core` are not correct (too many things,\r\n  required by some addons) while the ones for the addons don't list the\r\n  non-openerp dependencies.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
