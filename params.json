{"name":"openerpdist","tagline":"Build the OpenERP framework and addons as nice tarballs","body":"# openerpdist - Packaging and distributing OpenERP\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` builds the OpenERP framework and addons as nice tarballs, ready\r\nto be uploaded to pypi with minimal changes from upstream sources.\r\n\r\nThis project is unsupported by OpenERP s.a.\r\n\r\nPlease note that even if `openerpdist` itself uses a 3-clause BSD license, the\r\nresulting packages remain under the AGPL license.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` builds packages ready to be consumed by the Python\r\ninfrastructure. In particular, it uses the regular `setup.py` files (using\r\n`setuptools`), and the resulting tarballs are installable using e.g. `pip`.\r\n\r\nOne possible usage is to generate the desired packages and make them available\r\nthrough a web server with an HTML listing (e.g. Nginx with `autoindex on`).\r\nPackages can then be installed for instance in a new virtual env:\r\n\r\n    > virtualenv2 oe-env\r\n    > oe-env/bin/pip install openerp-sale \\\r\n        --no-index \\\r\n        --find-links http://localhost/tarballs\r\n\r\nPackage dependencies are extracted from the `__openerp__.py` descriptor files\r\nand listed in the generated `setup.py` files. This means that installing, say,\r\n`openerp-sale` will install all its dependencies, including `openerp-core` (the\r\npackage for the server/framework).\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nThe development version can be installed by cloning the Git repository and using cabal:\r\n\r\n    > git clone git://github.com/noteed/openerpdist.git\r\n    > cd openerpdist && cabal install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` is simple to use, either withing the server source directory, or\r\nwithin a specific addons.\r\n\r\nThe command\r\n\r\n    > openerpdist patch\r\n\r\nwhen run inside a serve source tree, will replace the existing `setup.py` and\r\n`MANIFEST.in` files, and when run inside a specific addons directory, will\r\ngenerate a `setup.py` file. Note that it will first check with `bzr diff` if\r\nthe directory (assumed to be a `.bzr` repository) is clean.\r\n\r\nOnce done, you can simply execute\r\n\r\n    > python2 setup.py sdist\r\n\r\nor alternatively\r\n\r\n    > openerpdist sdist\r\n\r\nto generate a nice tarball inside the newly created `dist` directory.\r\n\r\n## Limitations / TODO\r\n\r\n- Assume the directories where `openerpdist` is run are `bzr` repositories.\r\n- Does not generate a README file from the `__openerp__.py` descriptor.\r\n- The version used for each package is hard-coded to 7.0.1.\r\n- The listed dependencies for `openerp-core` are not correct (too many things,\r\n  required by some addons) while the ones for the addons don't list the\r\n  non-openerp dependencies.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-7990941-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
