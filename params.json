{"name":"openerpdist","tagline":"Build the OpenERP framework and addons as nice tarballs","body":"# openerpdist - Packaging and distributing OpenERP\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` builds the OpenERP framework and addons as nice tarballs, ready\r\nto be uploaded to pypi with minimal changes from upstream sources.\r\n\r\nThis project is unsupported by OpenERP s.a.\r\n\r\nPlease note that even if `openerpdist` itself uses a 3-clause BSD license, the\r\nresulting packages remain under the AGPL license.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nThe development version can be installed by cloning the Git repository and using cabal:\r\n\r\n    > git clone git://github.com/noteed/openerpdist.git\r\n    > cd openerpdist && cabal install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`openerpdist` is simple to use, either withing the server source directory, or\r\nwithin a specific addons.\r\n\r\nThe command\r\n\r\n    > openerpdist patch\r\n\r\nwhen run inside a serve source tree, will replace the existing `setup.py` and\r\n`MANIFEST.in` files, and when run inside a specific addons directory, will\r\ngenerate a `setup.py` file. Note that it will first check with `bzr diff` if\r\nthe directory (assumed to be a `.bzr` repository) is clean.\r\n\r\nOnce done, you can simple execute\r\n\r\n    > python2 setup.py sdist\r\n\r\nor alternatively\r\n\r\n    > openerpdist sdist\r\n\r\nto generate a nice tarball inside the newly created `dist` directory.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\n- Assume the directories where `openerpdist` is run are `bzr` repositories.\r\n","google":"UA-7990941-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
