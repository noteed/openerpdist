# openerpdist - Packaging and distributing OpenERP

openerpdist builds the OpenERP framework and addons as nice tarballs, ready to
be uploaded to pypi with minimal changes from upstream sources.

This project is unsupported by OpenERP s.a.

Please note that even if openerpdist itself uses a 3-clause BSD license, the
resulting packages remain under the AGPL license.
